# YOLOv5-train-on-custom-data
In this project we develop a YOLOv5 based object detection model for "Shotgun", "Handgun", and "Knife". You can easily create your own data from [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) and run this repo on your own custom data.  

## Dataset

The images for this project were collected from [Open Images](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html) using this toolkit [OIDv4](https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit)
